# MyFlixAngular

## Objective
To build the client-side for an application called MyFlixAngular based on myFlix app and its existing server-side code (REST API and database), with supporting documentation, using Angular.

## Context
As remote work becomes more important, effective communication and collaboration are crucial. This project aims to enhance collaboration skills by creating detailed handoffs for other developers. Building the client-side interface for the MyFlixAngular app using Angular will provide valuable experience in working with a widely-used framework for large projects.

## Project Overview & Requirements
The following sections provide information about the requirements for the app.

## The 5 W’s
**Who** — The users of the MyFlixAngular movie app and codebase, including other developers and designers.

**What** — A single-page, responsive movie app built with Angular, facilitating user requests and rendering responses from the server-side. Accompanied by relevant documentation and handoff deliverables.

**When** — Users can use the app whenever they want to read information about different movies or update their user information.

**Where** — The app will be hosted online, accessible from any device.

**Why** — Movie enthusiasts seek easy access to movie information. The app demonstrates Angular skills and ability to create documentation for developers and employers.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
